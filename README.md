# Text-Analyzer-by-Django
Text Utils
Text Utils is a simple Django web application that allows users to analyze and manipulate text. Users can input text and apply operations such as removing punctuation, converting to uppercase, and removing new lines. The application is built using Django for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, and provides a clean, user-friendly interface.
Features

Remove Punctuation: Strip punctuation marks from the input text.
Convert to Uppercase: Transform the input text to all uppercase letters.
Remove New Lines: Eliminate newline characters from the text.
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly interface.
Simple Navigation: Includes a navigation bar with Home, About Us, and Contact Us links (placeholders for future expansion).

Technologies Used

Django: Python-based web framework for backend development.
Bootstrap 5: Frontend framework for responsive and styled UI.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
Python: Core programming language for the application logic.
